### AWS CLI, terraform setup and terraforming process

<br />

#### If environment is setup:
- Run **_"terraform init"_** in **/aws** folder
- Then **_"terraform apply"_** in **/aws** folder

#### If environment is required:
- Run **_./terra_setup_** which will:
  - Download and install Terraform
  - Set up your AWS credentials
  - Configure Terraform (might need some manual work)
  - Initialize Terraforming process (with a prompt)
